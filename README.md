# CallCentreDesign
A call centre with features like :


1)Customer can start a call


2)Customer can end a call



3)If a person in lower level hierarchy is not free--> call can be tranfered to the persons higher in hierarchy !!


Feature yet to implement:

If a perosn lower in hierarchy cant handle the call he must transfer it to a person higher in hierarchy !!




PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent,
manager and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a
respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must
escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it,
then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and data
structures for this problem. Implement a method dispatchCaLL() which assigns a
call to the first available employee.
